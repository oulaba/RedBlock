## üìå Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of our paper *"[Your Paper Title]"*.  
It aims to **[brief description, e.g., "implement an enhanced multi-bit watermarking technique for large language models to improve robustness and detection accuracy"]**.

Our implementation builds upon the open-source code from the following two works (both under the Apache License 2.0):

### üìÑ Reference Works

## üöÄ Key Modifications

Compared to the original implementations, we have:

- **New Features** ‚Äî e.g., added a new watermark embedding algorithm to enhance robustness.  
- **Performance Improvements** ‚Äî optimized the watermark detection module for up to 20% higher efficiency.  
- **Bug Fixes** ‚Äî resolved compatibility issues in the original code.  
- **Integration** ‚Äî unified the data preprocessing pipeline across both implementations.  

> For detailed technical changes, refer to inline comments in the code and our paper.
